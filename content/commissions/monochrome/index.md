Grayscale images, are black-and-white or gray monochrome, and composed exclusively of shades of gray. The contrast ranges from black at the weakest intensity to white at the strongest.

Grayscale images are distinct from one-bit bi-tonal black-and-white images, which, in the context of computer imaging, are images with only two colors: black and white (also called bilevel or binary images). Grayscale images have many shades of gray in between.
