Shading is the technique used in drawing to create the illusion of depth and volume on a two-dimensional surface by manipulating light and shadow. 

This process helps define the form of objects, providing a sense of realism and dimensionality. By understanding how light interacts with various shapes, artists can depict basic forms like cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones more effectively, as well as complex subjects such as facial features.
