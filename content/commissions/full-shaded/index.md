Shading adds depth and volume to drawings by creating contrasts between light and dark areas, which help define the shape of objects. 

When an artist applies shading correctly, it enhances the viewer's perception of three-dimensionality. This technique allows even simple forms like cubes and spheres to appear more realistic by mimicking how light interacts with these objects.
